                <p>Clients and Servers</p>
                <p>Computers connected to the Web are called clients and servers.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Clients are the Typical Web user's Internet-connected devices (for example, 
                        your computer connected to your Wi-Fi, or your phone connected to your mobile 
                        network) and Web-accessing software available on those devices (usually a web 
                        browser like Firefox or Chrome).</li>
                    <li>Servers are computers that store webpages, sites, or apps. When a client device 
                        wants to access a webpage, a copy of the webpage is downloaded from the server 
                        onto the client machine to be displayed in the user's web browser.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>So What Actually Happens?</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The browser goes to the DNS server and finds the real address of the server 
                        that the website lives on.</li>
                    <li>The browser sends an HTTP request message to the server asking it to send copy 
                        of the website to the client.</li>
                    <li>If the server approves the client's request, the server sends the client a "200 
                        OK" message, which means "Permission granted! Here you go!", and then starts sending 
                        the website's files to the browser as a series of small chunks.</li>
                    <li>The browser assembles the small chunks into a complete website and displays it to you!</li>

                    <p>The Big 3 - HTML, CSS, JavaScript</p>
                    <p>While the server can process information in many different languages, the files that they 
                        serve to the client are always going to be some combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!</p>
